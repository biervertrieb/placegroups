## Developing inside a Container, Source Code on local machine

The Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers extension lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. It allows you to open any folder inside (or mounted into) a container and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set.

### Requirements

- install Git
- install Docker Desktop
- install VS Code
- install Remote Development extension pack for VS Code

### Setup

- go to your workspace directory
- clone https://github.com/biervertrieb/placegroups
- open VS Code inside workspace directory and press Ctrl+Shift+P
- execute "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"

### First Steps

- open and read notebooks/0.0-start_here.ipynb
- look at some other Notebooks
- start your own Jupyter Notebook!

## Best Practices

- never commit to "main" branch
- create your own branches and commit changes
- pull from origin before creating a new branch
- write Unit Tests for every piece of code
- never copy and paste duplicate code
- write reusable code
- automate as much as possible

## Workflow for adding features and refactoring code

- pull from origin
- create a new branch from main and name it appropriately according to your task
- write code, test, run, verify
- you may commit as much incremental changes as you like
- publish / push your new branch to origin
- finish your task, commit to your branch, and...
- create a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch
