placegroups
==============================

This software is part of a Big Data Analytics course project made by comp sci students. It aims to find groupings of users in the dataset of r/place with common interests.


## Motivation

r/place was a social experiment conducted by reddit.com in which users could draw single pixels on a large canvas. In order to create artwork users had to collaborate in communities. Because of space restrictions conflicts, diplomacy, and politics surrounding the canvas emerged. reddit.com released the dataset to the public.
